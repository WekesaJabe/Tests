Instructions for Python Practice Questions
1. GitHub Repository Setup
Create a new repository on GitHub for this project.
Name the repository something relevant, like python-variables-and-control-flow-practice.
Ensure your repository is public so that the instructor can review your code.
Commit and push your solutions to this repository after completing each question.
2. Project Structure
Each question should be written in a separate Python file. Name the files according to the question, such as:
question1.py for Variable Assignment & Arithmetic Operations.
question2.py for Odd or Even Checker, and so on.
Make sure your code is well-organized and readable, using comments where necessary to explain key steps.
3. Content Review Before the Assessment
Before starting the assessment, ensure you understand the following concepts. These will help you solve the problems more easily:
Variables and Primitive Types: How to declare and use variables, understanding integers, floats, strings, and booleans.
Control Flow Statements: Understanding how to use if, elif, and else statements for decision-making.
Loops : Understanding how to use for , and while loops 
Sequences : Working with Lists , Tuples and dictionaries 
4. Assessment Expectations
Focus on clear, logical code and make sure to test your solutions with different inputs.






Questions 
Loops
Write a Python program that prints the numbers from 1 to 50 using a for loop. For numbers that are divisible by 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number, and for numbers divisible by 5, print "Buzz". For numbers divisible by both, print "FizzBuzz".
Using a while loop, write a function that continuously asks the user for input until they type the word "exit". The program should print each word entered by the user before asking for the next input.
Sequences (Lists, Tuples, and Dictionaries)
Given the list nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], write a Python function using a loop that returns the sum of all the numbers in the list.  :: Breakout Room 1 .

Write a function that accepts a list of strings and returns a new list where each string is reversed. For example, for the input ["apple", "banana", "cherry"], the function should return ["elppa", "ananab", "yrrehc"].
Write a Python function that takes a dictionary as input and prints all the keys whose values are even numbers. Example: Given the dictionary {'a': 2, 'b': 3, 'c': 4}, the function should print 'a' and 'c'.
Given a tuple of numbers, e.g., (10, 20, 30, 40, 50), write a Python function using a loop that returns the largest number in the tuple.  : Breakout Room 2 
  
Function Writing Using Loops and Sequences
Write a function called remove_duplicates that takes a list as input and returns a new list with all duplicate elements removed. You cannot use the set function to solve this problem.
Write a function that takes a dictionary and an integer n as input and returns a list of keys from the dictionary where the value is greater than n. For example, for the dictionary {'a': 5, 'b': 12, 'c': 3} and n = 4, the function should return ['a', 'b'].
Write a Python function that accepts a list of integers and a target sum. The function should return True if there are two distinct numbers in the list that add up to the target sum, and False otherwise.  :: Breakout room 3. 

Write a function that takes a list of tuples as input, where each tuple contains two elements: a string and an integer (e.g., ("apple", 5)). The function should return a dictionary where the strings are the keys and the integers are the values.
